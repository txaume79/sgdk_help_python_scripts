bisect.py 
- bisects an object on N slices following an axis 
meshdeformbind.py 
- copy an object N times following an axis 
- adds one cube mesh for each copy that circumscribes them - that is, the cube is big enough to contain the model
- uses each cube as a meshdeform gizmo binding it to the copied object
