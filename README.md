## A Note from the verbose author TheNomCognom - 18/04/2025

This repo contains a set of scripts that i've been making during a SGDK game cration process. I share with the hope
that the code can help others where i struggled my mind during hours. They are not meant to be used directly maybe,
as they are for such specific cases, but they contain some code that can be useful for others, specially for blender.

Here you will find (It will be always WIP)

- pyhton scripts to run from console
    
- blender python api scripts to be run under blender scrpit window

In the future, some lua code for libresprite and aseprite.

See each folder readme in order to get some info about them.

Cheers.
